# mctraining

This project contains slides, directions and a utility for setting up a Materials Commons training server.

# Slides
You can find the training deck slides in the slides directory. These slides provide step by step directions to
teach the concepts behind Materials Commons and how to use the web application.

# cmd
The cmd directory contains the source code for the mctraining utility. This utility will help you to setup
a test project. The provide database in the db directory contains a single project training_template that
is used by mctraining to set up other training projects.
